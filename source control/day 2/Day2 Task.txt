2-what is pull request and request & differrent bettween them?
A pull request (PR) is a feature in version control systems like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. It allows developers 
   to propose changes they've made in a branch of a repository to be merged into another branch (commonly the main or master branch).
   It's a critical part of collaborative software development.

A request, in general terms, refers to asking or submitting for something. In the context of software development or GitHub

local :git branch -d new-email
----------------------------------------------------------------------
5-What is the command to push the current repository to the remote origin?
git push origin main
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
6-what is git Rebase and how to use it ?
Git rebase is a command used to integrate changes from one branch into another by moving or reapplying commits. 
Unlike git merge, which combines the histories of two branches, git rebase rewrites the commit history to create a linear progression of changes.

Rebasing is often used to:
-Clean up commit history.
-Keep a feature branch up-to-date with the latest changes from the base branch (e.g., main).
-Simplify history for cleaner merges.
git checkout <branch>
git rebase < base branch>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
7-What is the command to get all the change history of the remote repository "origin"?
git fetch origin
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8-What is the command to show the differences between the current branch and the branch "new-email"?
git diff new-email

9-what is tags and Make five tags and release two of them?
Tags in Git are references to specific points in the repositoryâ€™s history. They are often used to mark important commits, such as version releases. There are two types of tags:

1-Lightweight Tags: Just a pointer to a commit, without additional metadata.
2-Annotated Tags: Stored as full objects in Git with metadata like a tagger name, email, and message.

--make five tag--
   light weight tags
     git tag v1.0
     git tag v2.0
   annotated tags
     git tag -a v3.0 -m "Version 3.0 release"
     git tag -a v4.0 -m "Version 4.0 release"
     git tag -a v5.0 -m "Version 5.0 release"

--release two tags--
     git push origin v3.0
     git push origin v4.0

Make SSh to your repo.
SSH (Secure Shell) keys are used to establish a secure connection between your computer and GitHub,
 allowing you to perform Git operations without needing to enter your password every time.

1. Create a New SSH Key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email"

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

then add the key to your github from sitting
